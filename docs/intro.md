## Why bun-git-hooks?

Git hooks are powerful tools for automating tasks in your development workflow, but they can be challenging to manage and distribute across a team. `bun-git-hooks` solves this by:

1. **Simplifying Configuration**: Use TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON to define your hooks
2. **Ensuring Consistency**: Automatically install hooks for all team members
3. **Providing Flexibility**: Skip hooks when needed with environment variables
4. **Type Safety**: Get IDE autocompletion and type checking for your configurations

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:

```bash
bun add -D bun-git-hooks
```

2. Create a configuration file (e.g., `git-hooks.config.ts`):

```ts
import type { GitHooksConfig } from 'bun-git-hooks'

const config: GitHooksConfig = {
  'pre-commit': 'bun run lint && bun run test',
  'commit-msg': 'bun commitlint --edit $1',
  'pre-push': 'bun run build',
  'verbose': true,
}

export default config
```

3. The hooks will be automatically installed when you run `bun install`

## Configuration Options

### Supported Config Files

- `git-hooks.config.ts` (TypeScript)
- `git-hooks.config.js` (JavaScript)
- `git-hooks.config.cjs` (CommonJS)
- `git-hooks.config.json` (JSON)
- `package.json` (with `gitHooks` field)

### Environment Variables

- `SKIP_BUN_GIT_HOOKS`: Set to "1" to skip hook execution
- `BUN_GIT_HOOKS_RC`: Path to initialization script
- `SKIP_INSTALL_GIT_HOOKS`: Set to "1" to skip hook installation

## Advanced Features

### Custom Initialization Scripts

Create a `.git-hooks.rc` file to set up environment variables or perform custom initialization:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export NODE_ENV=development
export CUSTOM_VAR=value
```

### Skip Hooks Temporarily

```bash
# Skip hooks for a single command
SKIP_BUN_GIT_HOOKS=1 git commit -m "message"

# Skip hook installation
SKIP_INSTALL_GIT_HOOKS=1 bun install
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hooks not installing**
   - Ensure `bun-git-hooks` is in your `devDependencies`
   - Check if `SKIP_INSTALL_GIT_HOOKS` is not set to "1"
   - Verify your configuration file is valid

2. **Hooks not executing**
   - Check if `SKIP_BUN_GIT_HOOKS` is not set to "1"
   - Verify hook scripts have execute permissions
   - Enable verbose mode in config for detailed logs

3. **TypeScript configuration issues**
   - Ensure you're using the correct type imports
   - Check your `tsconfig.json` includes the package types
